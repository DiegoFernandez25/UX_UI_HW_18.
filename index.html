    <p>Hello, I am Diego Fernandez, an up and coming UX/UI Designer. I recently graduated from UTSA and am looking at an opportunity to grow my skills. I am passionate about my work and am always looking to learn new skills and looking for ways to collaborate with others. I enjoy solving user problems and blank. My skills include user research and usability testing as well as collaboration and prototyping. What makes me unique is my creativity and my passion for wanting to be the best. I am from San Antonio, TX and would ideally want to work for blank</p>

            <h3>User Research and Usability Testing</h3>

            <h3>Prototyping/Wireframing</h3>
            <p> I am good at focusing prioritizing page elements based on user needs to make the wireframing the best it can be. I am also skilled at prototyping at multiple levels and making sure it is done well to be able to run tests and gather effective feedback needed in order to improve the prototype.</p>

            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>I am skilled at effectively organizing and structuring content whether it be through a presentation, a prototype, or a usability testing. I make it easier for the user to find where they are, locate relative information needed, find where they need to go and whats next. I am also skilled at working on projects with very bad information architecture and finding the important and relevant information.</p>
